    <!-- For Students -->
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h2>👩‍🎓 For Students</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">❓ How do I register as a student?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Click on "Student Register" in the navigation menu. Fill out the registration form with your personal details, disability information, and examination requirements. Upload your disability certificate (PDF, JPG, or PNG format). Submit the form and wait for admin approval. You'll receive a confirmation email once approved.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">❓ What documents do I need to provide?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          You need to provide a valid disability certificate issued by a medical professional or relevant authority. The certificate should clearly state your disability type and any specific requirements. Additional documents like student ID or institutional verification may be requested by administrators.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">❓ How long does it take to get a scribe assigned?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          After your registration is approved, scribe assignment typically takes 2-5 business days depending on availability and your examination schedule. We recommend registering at least 2 weeks before your examination date to ensure adequate time for matching and coordination.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">❓ Can I request a specific scribe?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          While you cannot directly request a specific scribe, you can specify preferences such as subject expertise, language preference, and availability. Our matching system and administrators consider these preferences when making assignments. If you've worked with a scribe before and had a positive experience, you can mention this in special requirements.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">❓ What if I need to cancel or reschedule?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          If you need to cancel or reschedule, contact us immediately through the Contact Us page or email support@hand2hand.edu. Please provide at least 48 hours notice when possible. This allows us to notify the scribe and potentially reassign them or find a replacement for your new date.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">❓ Can I use Hand2Hand for multiple examinations?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">

      <h2>✍️ For Scribes</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">❓ What qualifications do I need to become a scribe?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Scribes should have good writing skills, patience, and the ability to accurately transcribe spoken words. While formal qualifications aren't strictly required, we prefer volunteers with educational backgrounds relevant to the subjects they'll assist with. Most importantly, you must be able to write clearly, follow instructions, and maintain professionalism.

      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">❓ How much time commitment is required?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          The time commitment varies based on your availability and the number of assignments you accept. Each examination typically lasts 2-4 hours. You have full control over your availability schedule and can update it anytime. There's no minimum commitment required - volunteer as much or as little as your schedule allows.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">❓ Will I be compensated for my services?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Hand2Hand operates on a volunteer basis. While scribes are not monetarily compensated, you gain valuable experience, contribute to inclusive education, and receive recognition through our platform's rating system. Some institutions may offer volunteer certificates or letters of recommendation for your service.

      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">❓ What are my responsibilities as a scribe?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          As a scribe, you must: arrive punctually for assigned examinations, write exactly what the student dictates without interpretation or correction, maintain confidentiality of examination content, remain neutral and not influence student responses, follow all examination rules and institutional policies, and report any issues to administrators promptly.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">❓ Can I decline an assignment?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Yes, you can decline assignments if they don't fit your schedule or expertise. However, we encourage you to update your availability calendar proactively to avoid being assigned during times you're unavailable. Repeated last-minute cancellations may affect your standing on the platform.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">❓ How do I update my availability?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
